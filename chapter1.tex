\section{Summary}

The purpose of this project is to develop (developing?) a fullstack (?) system for surveillance proposes using mobile robots, both ground and flying ones.
Since the project is quite big (?), it is shared with other two students with each one of us focusing into a specific subtask (?). It is constituted of: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item a planning system, responsible for dispatching the surveillance tasks to UGVs and/or UAVs in the best possible way based on their battery charge, giving them some waypoints to follow in order to follow the optimal path.
  \item a solution to autonomously control the drones (UAVs robots)
  \item a solution to autonomously control ground robots avoiding dynamic obstacles (UGVs robots)
\end{itemize}

Basically, all the work is done using \Acrshort{ros}2\footnote{The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications\cite{ros2desc}} which gives us the possibility to work separately on your own project, and since everyone creates his custom packages, at the end we only need to put everything together.

A more detailed description can be found in the first chapter.

The reason behind my choice about the internship and this consequent thesis is leaded by my growing interest in this topic: just some month before taking part in this work I attended a course about {\it robotic fundamentals}\cite{intro2robotics} in which I had to work in a custom project similar to this, but using a manipulator.

For me, is the possibility to give to some inanimate object, like a wheeled robot or a manipulator, something that could be described as intelligence, the ability to perform some tasks in response of other ones, figuring out which ones are the best for every particular situation. Another aspect I really like is the (inbuilt) utility which carries (within) itself: this is only an educational project, but it is easy to imagine an industrial application, for example for patrol purposes. // ?

Some challenges I decided to took are the choice of the new version of ROS, with some great improves respect to the older one, but with less community support, and also working for the first time with a mobile robot.
