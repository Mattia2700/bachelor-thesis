\chapter{Working in a simulated environment}

The choice to develop (?) a simulated environment was due to the fact I could not be always in the robotic laboratory, because of other didactic activities. If you do a good job with the abstraction when setting up your simulated robot and world, everything else that was working before, should now continue to work; the goal is to create a simulation as close as possible to the real world, so you can not tell which environment\footnote{real or simulated} you are using.

Part of the setup I am going to present is inspired to Automatic Addison tutorials\cite{tutorials}.
