Robots are increasingly being employed today to help human beings in their tasks: from automating a production chain to helping people in need, from working in dangerous situation to replacing people in repetitive tasks, saving time and energy. This thesis, in fact, discusses the design of a surveillance system based on ground robots, developed in the past few months during my internship at the Robotics Laboratory in the University of Trento. 

Using the provided robots, a fully functional system has been developed, which can be used in university environments, but it is not limited to this. Indeed, this project can also be thought of as a playground: it can run in a simulation, and thanks to the fact the simulated environment has been kept as close as possible to the real one, no matter where you are testing things out, they should work without any big difference. In this manner,  if you want to test new algorithms and technics, you no longer need to use the real robots and be physically in the Lab, just start the simulator.

In addition to the navigation system, a planning system developed by another student has been integrated: thanks to a web interface you can specify the areas that you want the robots to patrol, and then the available ones will be assigned to the task; they will move autonomously, returning their feedback.
